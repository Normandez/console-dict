# console-dict
Console dictionary emulator

# Functions
* Print all dictionary
* Print only word/description
* Search by word/description (case insensitive)
* Edit dictionary records
* Add/remove dictionary records

# Dictionary file
Dictionary file - it's simple TXT file which contains records, separated via empty lines. Record format is: <WORD> -(dash!) <VALUE>. Just edit dictionary only via app and you will have no problems! Yes, it's a good idea to provide at least XML-save format. And it's a good idea too to load dictionary partially. But I have not time for this rigth now =)

# Run
Just build JAR and run it from your terminal/command line, or from IDE console. But remember, for cyrillic symbols support your terminal should support it (appropriate encoding) too.
